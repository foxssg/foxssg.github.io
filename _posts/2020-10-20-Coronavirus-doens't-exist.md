Maybe we're (or I'm) a simulation, and coronavirus is fake, all people are told to say that they got coronavirus, some died, some recovered but they want to test you (me) to see how much time we self-impresonered ourselves in a lockdown, I'm working from home since march, so I've been living imprisionered for more than six motnhs by my self. They wwant to research how our machilne learning minds works, so this is a test.
