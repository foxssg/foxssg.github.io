I've tried freebsd, openbsd, ghostbsd and some other bsd distros but every time something was wrong.
LAtely I've been using NomadBSD and everything works out of the box, wifi, touchpad, etc.
I've been having some random difficulties with my second display, some glitchy random shits with the second display and one day some programs won't start, but I thing that the last thing was because I had screw something up with openbox. Apart from that everything is ok.
