## Syncthing

Syncthing is a fantastic open source program, Syncthing let you share files from almost any os, linux, android, bsd, etc.

I used to use google drive, but I've replaced it with this, now I have all my backups in a pendrive and then my important files that I've keep at hand I keep them in all my devices with Syncthing.

I used to upload my password encrypted in the cloud but now I don't have to expose them to the internet.

I used to use google calendar and google notes, but now I do my notes on emacs org mode and I'm using emacs too for my calendar, then I share the org files with all my devices, for android there is orgzy app that is pretty neat.
