## Doom Emacs

I've always been a vim user, but recently I've been using emacs, but vainilla emacs is literally painful, I'm saying this because it's keybindings, you have to press ctrl a lot, so I'm using Doom Emacs that is a pre-configured emacs with evil mode, evil mode is vim mode, you can use emacs with 90% of the vim flow, so perfect for me.
