I've been doing intermitent fasting for 3 years now and it's awesome. I started 12/12 without taking breakfast, then 16/8 without taking dinner and now I'm doing 20/4. I eat my first meal near 10 and then I eat lunch near 13, I only eat two times in a range of 4 hours.
I feel better in general, I get less hungry, I less prone to eat junk food, I lost like 10 kg and I'm eating almost the same than before.
There are information on the internet about other things that are beneficial for people who do intermitent fasting but because I'm not an export I only talk about my experience, but feel free to search the web for more useful information, you use at least try intermitent fasting for 2 months, but beware of your general health if you're in doubt ask a doctor opinion before.
